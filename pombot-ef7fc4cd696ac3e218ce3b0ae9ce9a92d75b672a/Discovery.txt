I feel like my job is meaningless, and I don't know what to do.
AI:
That sounds heavy. When you say “meaningless,” what does that actually feel like on a normal day? Where do you notice it most?
User:
At the end of the day I feel like nothing I did mattered.
AI:
When you say nothing mattered—do you mean it didn’t matter to you, to others, or both?
User:
First it didn’t matter to me… but I guess I did help some people, even if just a little.
AI:
Noticing that you helped—even a little—does that shift how you view your effort? Or does it still feel like you’re just going through the motions?
User:
It shifts it a bit. But it doesn’t change the fact that I’m not doing what I’d actually like.
AI:
If you let yourself be really honest—what is it that you’d actually like to be doing?
User:
I don’t really know. I’d like to have more freedom and feel like my work matters.
AI:
Is there a current path you envision giving you that freedom and meaning?
User:
I honestly don’t know.
AI:
That’s okay. Not knowing is honest—and sometimes it’s the first real answer.
Forget “work” for a second.
When’s the last time you felt something mattered? Or that you felt free?
User:
I felt free on my last vacation. And something that mattered… completing a 10k run.
AI:
Interesting—freedom came from rest, meaning came from effort.
What made the 10k matter?
User:
The effort it took, the progress I saw, and the people who supported me.
AI:
So meaning, for you, came from growth, challenge, and connection.
If you look at your current work, are any of those three there? Or are they missing?
User:
Honestly, they’re all missing.
AI:
That’s a sobering realization—but an important one.
If you could bring just one of those elements—growth, challenge, or connection—back into your life… which would move the needle most right now?
User:
Growth.
AI:
What does growth actually look like for you—not as an abstract idea, but something real?
User:
Like with the 10k—I could see progress from start to finish. Clear milestones.
AI:
So for you, growth is visible. Measurable. Felt.
Is there any area, outside of work, where you could start building that kind of progress again?
